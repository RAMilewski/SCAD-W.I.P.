I've been thinking a bit about how we can optimally organize the new space after the move.  I'd like to propose that we employ some of our under-used assets to that end.

We have 5 working 3d printers that are idle 95% of the time, and Rick is in the process of bringing 2 more on line.  We also have a small mountain of donated filament.  So the solution that comes to mind is **MULTIBOARD**.

It's a 3d-printer super-pegboard replacement with .STLs available for more than 3000 hooks, brackets, shelves and bins.

I'm currently printing some to re-organize my home printer workspace and garage, and I'm quite pleased with the system.  The designers have come up with some 3d-printing tricks for printing very strong parts (some hooks are rated at 20Kg),
and a way to stack parts along the z-axis.   Both of these clever tricks can be applied to other 3d print projects, and will be topics for the January 7th meeting of the 3d-printing group at Spark next Wednesday at 7pm.

If you have a printer at home and can donate some print time that would be most welcome too.

Come join us for the meeting and let's see if we can get this project off the ground!

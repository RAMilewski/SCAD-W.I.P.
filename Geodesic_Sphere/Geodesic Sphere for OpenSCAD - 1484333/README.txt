Geodesic Sphere for OpenSCAD by Jamie_K on Thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1484333

Summary:
Geodesic sphere for OpenSCAD, intended to be a drop-in replacement for sphere() for those cases when you want uniformly spaced facets that don't bunch up at the poles.Respects parameters "r" or "d" just like built-in sphere(), and also respects $fa, $fs, and $fn to produce approximately comparable facet sizes.

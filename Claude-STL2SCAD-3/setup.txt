# STL to OpenScad reconstruction

You are running inside a Debian system with sudo, brew, python3 and whatever you need to accomplish this task.

Your job is to take the STL file in this workspace and reconstruct a copy of it using OpenSCAD and the BOSL2 Library.

If the STL is too large or complex, you can try decimating it/using octrees/segmenting it/using marching cubes as needed.

## Requirements

- The final STL file must be within 0.1mm accuracy of the original
- the OpenSCAD code must use the BOSL2 Library to whatever extent possible.
- The OpenSCAD code must be modular, readable, and have relevant constants surfaced at the beginning for a customizer
- You should focus on building reusable tools, not one-off scripts
- You should maintain a plan.md file with your progress checklist and tick off items (including failed approaches) as you make progress
